/**
 * Created by Phoebe on 9/20/2017.
 * put your name "created by" slot above so the team this year and next year will know who wrote it and
 * who to ask for help if they need the program/need to modify it. Follow with a very brief description
 * of your program so another programmer can understand it even after you graduate.
 *
 * This comment will usually not be this long... anyway, this program will be a sample hardware class.
 * It will use four standard motors in a linear drive and two servos, one CR, one 180 degrees, just to
 * show you how to program each.
 *
 * The naming convention that we use is ClassNameHardware. For example, a holonomic drive train hardware class
 * should be HolonomicHardware, with no spaces or underscores, just capitals for new words
